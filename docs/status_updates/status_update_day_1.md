#Status update Day 1

## Monday

Today, we had a [productive meeting](https://bitlab.bit-academy.nl/top-gs/move-to-impact/-/blob/main/docs/collect/pitch_summary.md) with our client, Move to Impact. They communicated their expectations and requested a landingspage for their website. After the meeting, each team member brainstormed individually, and we combined our ideas to create one concept for the page. We then created a [project plan](https://bitlab.bit-academy.nl/top-gs/move-to-impact/-/blob/main/docs/project_plan.md) to ensure that we stay on track and meet the client's expectations. Overall, we are excited to move forward and bring our ideas to life.
