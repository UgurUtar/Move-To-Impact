## Business case
Move to impact has developed a LMS to help businesses become CSRD compliant, the problem they're facing is that there is not really a landing page to push this specific product to clients and the information that is available on their site feels out of place

## Client wishes
- Client wants a landing page following their stylebook
- Landing page should be flashy
- Landing page should have multiple CTA's
- Landing page should include appointment booking system
- Landing page should include email collection form for internal newsletter

## Further action
mid project check-in with product owner to discuss ideas and narrow down
