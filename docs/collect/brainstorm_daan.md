## Tooling

## Ideas
### Booking functionality
The client voiced their wish to add this functionality for easily scheduling demo's with clients.
We'll create an appointment scheduling integration with a panel for managing these appointments

Avantages:
- custom integration offers a lot of flexibility
- No dependencies on third party service providers

Disadvantages:
- Not battle tested
- Time constraints


### Email collection
The client wants a field for collecting emails, we'll create a panel to easily manage the collected emails
and provide different filters to measure the email quality or check if it is a business email for example

Avantages:
- Filter options
- Easily extendible to manage more data

Disadvantages:
- Possible conflicts with internal systems used by the client

### Manage sending newslettters
The client wants to keep potential clients posted on their product and new developments in the market they serve,
so we'll build a place to manage sending these emails

Avantages:
- Easy connection with the email collection functionality
- No dependencies on third party service providers

Disadvantages:
- Possible confilcts with internal systems used by the client
