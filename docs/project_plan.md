### Short project overview

---

Move To Impact has identified a problem with their current marketing efforts for their learning management system (LMS) designed to assist businesses in achieving compliance with the Corporate Social Responsibility and Diversity (CSRD) requirements. Despite the increasing demand for CSRD compliance, the company has no specific landing page to promote the LMS, and the information currently available on their website is out of place.

To address this, we will be building a new and eye-catching landing page specifically for the CSRD LMS. This page will provide a centralized location for customers to learn about the product, understand the importance of CSRD compliance, and see how the LMS can help their business meet these requirements. By having a dedicated and effective landing page, Move To Impact will be better equipped to communicate the value of their product and meet the growing demand for CSRD compliance solutions.

## The goal

---

The objective of this project is to create a dedicated landing page for Move To Impact's CSRD learning management system (LMS) and to develop a dashboard for managing product demo's.

By having a specific landing page for the CSRD LMS, Move To Impact will be able to refocus their marketing efforts and provide a centralized location for customers to learn about the product. This will help the company better communicate the value of their solution and meet the growing demand for CSRD compliance.

The dashboard for managing product demonstrations will streamline the scheduling process and provide a convenient way for potential customers to book appointments to see the LMS in action. This will help the sales team to efficiently manage their time and effectively demonstrate the capabilities of the product.

## Target audience

---

The target audience for a system like this is businesses and organizations looking to meet CSRD requirements and promote responsible corporate citizenship. This includes companies in various industries and of varying sizes, from small startups to large multinational corporations.

Clients choose Move to impact because they provide a comprehensive and user-friendly LMS that makes the road to becoming CSRD compliant easy and insightfull

### Technical specifications

For the landing page of the project, we are using Laravel for the back end and a combination of HTML, CSS, Tailwind, and Flowbite for the front end. Laravel is a PHP framework and provides a robust set of tools for building web applications. HTML, CSS, Tailwind, and Flowbite are used to create the user interface and provide a responsive and visually appealing design. This combination of technologies allows us to create a high-quality and user-friendly landing page.
